    <p>
        My name is Duong Duong. I'm currently a senior,
        hoping to graduate this summer, but as faith have it, my hope and dream was crushed when I was dennied of my fifth class.
        Now I'm looking forward to spend another semester here at our beloved school, not throwing my cap in the air.
