        <p>
            I have next to no experience in web developement.
            The only thing I know so far is everything we went over in class during the past two weeks.
            In today world, Web Developement been taking the internet by strom.
            More and more people getting interested in web. Eventhough web development is not the path I pick toward graduation,
            but I'd think why not take this chance to introduce myself to the world of web developing.
